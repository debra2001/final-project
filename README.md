In today’s technology-driven world, the demand for efficient and effective technical support systems has never been higher. Users frequently encounter technical issues that require prompt and accurate resolutions to maintain productivity and satisfaction. Despite the availability of various technical support systems, many users still experience delays and frustrations due to the inadequacy of these systems in addressing specific needs efficiently. 
This chapter will delve into the background of the study, clearly articulate the problem statement, and outline the objectives and research questions guiding the study. By doing so, it establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding the scope and direction of the research, setting the stage for the subsequent chapters. 

 1.2 Background of the Study

In the digital age, technical support systems are essential for maintaining and optimizing the functionality of technology-dependent environments. However, existing support systems often fall short in addressing specific user needs effectively. These systems tend to be overly generalized, resulting in inadequate problem resolution and user frustration. 
Existing research underscores the necessity for more tailored and user-centric support solutions. Studies by Smith (2020) and Jones (2019) have highlighted the inefficiencies in current systems, emphasizing the need for improvement in how user issues are matched with technical experts. The gap identified in these studies forms the basis of this research, which aims to design and implement a user-centric technical expertise support system that overcomes these challenges. 

This study proposes the design and implementation of an effective user-centric technical expertise support system. This system aims to address the shortcomings of existing solutions by leveraging  user-friendly interface. The goal is to create a support system that significantly improves the user experience by ensuring timely and accurate resolution of technical issues. The development and deployment of such a system could have a profound impact on the efficiency of technical support services, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction and better overall performance of technological environments.

2. Database Schema: Design the database schema to define the structure of the database, including tables, columns, and relationships between tables. This will be based on the requirements analysis and will ensure that the database can efficiently store and retrieve the required data.
3. Normalization: Normalize the database schema to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. This will involve breaking down tables into smaller, more manageable entities and ensuring that each table serves a single purpose.
4. Data Integrity: Implement mechanisms to enforce data integrity, such as constraints, indexes, and foreign key relationships. This will ensure that the data stored in the database is accurate and consistent.
5. Data Access: Define access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access the database. This will help protect the integrity and security of the data.
6. Scalability and Performance: Design the database to be scalable and performant, taking into account factors such as data volume, query complexity, and system load. This may involve techniques such as sharding, replication, and indexing.
By carefully designing the database for the user-centric technical expertise support system, we can ensure that it meets the requirements for data storage, retrieval, and management, and supports the overall functionality and performance of the system.


3.5.1 Table Design
The database for the user-centric technical expertise support system will be designed with the following tables to store relevant information:
1. Users Table: This table will store information about users, including their user ID, username, password (encrypted), email address, 
2. Support Requests Table: This table will store information about support requests submitted by users, including the request ID, user ID, request status for when the request was submitted and resolved.
4. Messages Table: This table will store messages exchanged between users and experts, including the message ID, sender ID, recipient ID, message content, and timestamps.
5. Payment Transactions Table: This table will store information about payment transactions, including the transaction ID, user ID, expert ID, transaction amount, payment status, and timestamps.
3.5.2 3NF Normalized Form
The database for the user-centric technical expertise support system will be designed to adhere to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to reduce data redundancy and ensure data integrity. Here's how the tables will be normalized:
1. Users Table (3NF):
   - UserID (Primary Key)
   - Username
   - Password (Encrypted)
   - Email
   - Role
2. Support Requests Table (3NF):
   - RequestID (Primary Key)
   - UserID (Foreign Key to Users.UserID)
   - ExpertID (Foreign Key to Experts.ExpertID)
   - Request Status
   

4. Messages Table (3NF):
   - MessageID (Primary Key)
   - SenderID .
   - RecipientID 
   - MessageContent


6. Payment Transactions Table (3NF):
   - TransactionID (Primary Key)
   - UserID (Foreign Key to Users.UserID)
   - ExpertID (Foreign Key to Experts.ExpertID)
   - TransactionAmount
   - PaymentStatus
   - Timestamp


By normalizing the database tables to the 3NF, we ensure that each table serves a single purpose and that data is stored without redundancy, leading to a more efficient and maintainable database design.

3.6 Testing Design
To ensure the usability and effectiveness of the user-centric technical expertise support system, the following testing approach will be employed:
 1. Usability Testing: Conduct usability testing with a group of representative users to evaluate the system's ease of use, efficiency, and user satisfaction. This will involve tasks such as submitting a support request, communicating with an expert, and providing feedback.
2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Engage users in UAT to validate that the system meets their requirements and expectations. Users will be asked to perform typical tasks and provide feedback on their overall experience with the system.
3. Remote Testing: Utilize remote testing tools and methods to allow users to test the system from their own environment. This can provide valuable insights into how users interact with the system in real-world scenarios.
4. Feedback Mechanisms: Implement feedback mechanisms within the system to collect user feedback on an ongoing basis. This will help identify usability issues and areas for improvement.
By incorporating these testing methods into the development process, we can ensure that the user-centric technical expertise support system is user-friendly, efficient, and meets the needs of its users.



3.6.1 Test Cases
To ensure thorough testing of the user-centric technical expertise support system, the following test cases will be implemented:
1. User Registration:
   - Test case 1: Verify that users can register for an account with valid credentials.
   - Test case 2: Verify that users cannot register with invalid or duplicate credentials.
2. Support Request Submission:
   - Test case 3: Verify that users can submit a support request with valid details.
   - Test case 4: Verify that users cannot submit a support request with missing or invalid details.
4. Messaging System:
